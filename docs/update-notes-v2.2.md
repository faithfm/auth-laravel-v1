# UPDATING THE PACKAGE to V2.2.0

In v2.2.0 we renamed Laravel's **authentication guard** names and **route middleware group** names.

For more information, see [Disambiguation of "Authentication Guard" and "Route Middleware Group" names](disambiguation-auth-guard-vs-middleware-group-names.md).



Notes:

* These changes need to be updated throughout a project, including configuration files for [external packages](external-package-config.md).

* **Route middleware group** names have been reverted since v4.0.0.
